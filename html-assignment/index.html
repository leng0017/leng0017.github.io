    <p>First, let me introduce myself, my name is Yue, come from China. It is my 10<sup>th</sup> year in Canada, finished my high school in PEI, which is a beautiful little island to me and now I'm in Ottawa. Ottawa is such a big city compared to <abbr title="Capital city of PEI">Charlottetown</abbr>. The biggest thing I feel better in Ottawa is the efficiency of public service, such as snow removal.Once there was a snow storm in Charlottetown, and the snow removal truck came like two days later, which could never happen in Ottawa. Anyway, glad I came to Ottawa.</p>
    <p>My favourite thing in the world is traveling. Traveling means a lot to me, because in my opinion, life is short, and it is necessary to see what the world looks like within a limited time. Meeting different people, experencing different cultures and visit different types of lands are my ultimate goals.</p>
